# Music Genre Classification Based on Audio
### by Botond Rimmel & DÃ¡niel Veress

#

This is a project work for the Deep Learning course at [AIT](https://www.ait-budapest.com/).

This project uses the [gtzan](https://huggingface.co/datasets/marsyas/gtzan) dataset to train a model and predict the genre of a given audio file. Our work consists of 3 parts:

1. processing the data and extracting features for the model
2. create, train and evaluate the model
3. enhancing the model (hyperparameter optimization and trying out different model types and techniques)

We expect the model to be able to predict the genres to an acceptable level.
