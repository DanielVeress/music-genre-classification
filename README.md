# Music Genre Classification Based on Audio
### by Boton Rimmel & DÃ¡niel Veress

#

This is a project work for the Deep Learning course at [AIT](https://www.ait-budapest.com/).

This project uses the [gtzan](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification) dataset to train a model and predict the genre of a given audio file. Our work consists of 3 parts, first we process the data and create features for the model. In the second part, we train a model and optimize its parameters. Finally, we evaluate the model and try to optimize the model further.
